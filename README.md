# Artemis Financial Software Security Enhancement

## Project Overview

**Client:** Artemis Financial  
**Project Scope:** Software Security Enhancement

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that manages client investments and provides asset management services. As part of their ongoing efforts to maintain secure operations and protect sensitive financial data, Artemis Financial sought to improve the security of their software applications. The main concern was to address potential vulnerabilities in the software and ensure that the code adhered to best security practices to prevent any malicious attacks or data breaches.

## Objective

The company wanted to ensure that their software, particularly the web-based application, was secure against external and internal threats. The goal was to identify security vulnerabilities, refactor the code to improve overall security, and implement secure coding practices throughout the application lifecycle.

## What We Did Well

When tasked with identifying and addressing the security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's application, I focused on several key aspects:

1. **Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment**: Using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and static code analysis, I identified potential weaknesses in third-party dependencies and the code itself.
2. **Refactoring for Security**: I enhanced the application’s security by implementing SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that sensitive data is transmitted securely and refactored code to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as hardcoded credentials and weak cryptography.
3. **Secure Coding Practices**: I adopted best practices like parameterized queries, input validation, and secure password hashing to prevent SQL injection and other common attacks.

### Why is it Important to Code Securely?

Secure coding practices are vital for protecting sensitive data, maintaining the integrity of applications, and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS). Insecure software opens the door to attacks, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities that can severely damage a company’s reputation, finances, and client trust. Secure coding helps mitigate these risks and contributes to the long-term success and stability of the organization.

### Value of Software Security to the Company’s Well-Being

By ensuring that Artemis Financial’s software is secure, I helped reduce the risk of financial loss, protect client data, and maintain trust. Software security contributes to operational continuity, regulatory compliance, and customer loyalty—essential for any company’s reputation in the financial services industry.

## Challenges and Helpful Insights

One of the challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was identifying third-party library vulnerabilities and determining how they could affect the overall system. These dependencies often had unknown risks, so it was crucial to carefully analyze and update them to their secure versions. The process taught me the importance of keeping all libraries up to date and actively monitoring for new vulnerabilities.

## Increasing Layers of Security

To increase the layers of security in the application, I implemented the following:

1. **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Configured HTTPS to secure data transmission.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Improved user authentication mechanisms with stronger password policies and secure session management.
3. **Code Refactoring**: Ensured that the code adhered to secure coding guidelines and eliminated common vulnerabilities.

In the future, I would use automated tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and Snyk for continuous monitoring of dependencies and static code analysis. I would also rely on penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities in a more dynamic and realistic environment.

## Ensuring Functional and Secure Code

After refactoring the code, I used several methods to ensure the application remained functional and secure:

1. **Unit and Integration Testing**: Performed thorough testing to validate that all features were working as expected.
2. **Static Analysis**: Ran static code analysis tools to identify any security flaws introduced during the refactoring.
3. **Dependency-Check**: Ran the `dependency-check` tool to ensure that no new vulnerabilities had been introduced through third-party libraries.

## Tools and Resources Used

1. **OWASP Dependency-Check**: A tool to scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
2. **Keytool**: For generating SSL certificates and keystores.
3. **Spring Security**: For securing application endpoints.
4. **Git**: For version control and tracking changes.

These tools and practices were invaluable in ensuring the security and functionality of the refactored code.

## Future Applications

For future tasks, I would highlight the following key elements of this project to employers:

- **Vulnerability Assessment Skills**: Using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify and resolve security issues.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Refactoring code to meet modern security standards.
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Implementing secure communication protocols for data protection.
- **Testing and Verification**: Ensuring that refactored code does not introduce vulnerabilities or break existing functionality.

This project demonstrates my ability to not only address security vulnerabilities but also to implement lasting solutions that align with industry best practices, ensuring the long-term security and stability of the software.
